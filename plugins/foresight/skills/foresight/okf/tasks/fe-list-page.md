in-domain: [web-frontend](../domains/web-frontend.md)

predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-41](../patterns/fs-41.md) Client derives answers from one page of a paginated list (12)
- [FS-26](../patterns/fs-26.md) Boundary values and NULL/join semantics not exercised (3)
- [FS-22](../patterns/fs-22.md) Capability built in one layer but never connected to the next (2)
- [FS-10](../patterns/fs-10.md) Interaction verified only on the mouse happy path (2)
- [FS-06](../patterns/fs-06.md) Per-row queries and unbounded fetches invisible at seed scale (2)
- [FS-04](../patterns/fs-04.md) Tests pass without proving the requirement (2)
