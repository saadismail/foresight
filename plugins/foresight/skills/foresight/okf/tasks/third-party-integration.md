# Task · Integrate a third-party API, SDK, webhook or platform

in-domain: [backend](../domains/backend.md)

predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-42](../patterns/fs-42.md) Third-party system semantics not honored (15)
- [FS-06](../patterns/fs-06.md) Per-row queries and unbounded fetches invisible at seed scale (4)
- [FS-25](../patterns/fs-25.md) Errors swallowed, conflated or silently defaulted (4)
- [FS-15](../patterns/fs-15.md) Producer and consumer of the same data disagree (3)
- [FS-37](../patterns/fs-37.md) Authorization decided on a proxy instead of the real identity or entitlement (3)
- [FS-03](../patterns/fs-03.md) Code written against an assumed interface instead of the real one (3)
- [FS-32](../patterns/fs-32.md) Side effects not ordered against the commit or outcome they depend on (2)
- [FS-55](../patterns/fs-55.md) Rule keyed on a proxy signal instead of the defining type, status or link (2)
- [FS-22](../patterns/fs-22.md) Capability built in one layer but never connected to the next (2)
