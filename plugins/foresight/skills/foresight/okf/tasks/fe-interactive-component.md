predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-10](../patterns/fs-10.md) Interaction verified only on the mouse happy path (37)
- [FS-01](../patterns/fs-01.md) Async client state read at the wrong moment or outliving its scope (8)
- [FS-13](../patterns/fs-13.md) Styling correct only in the context that was eyeballed (6)
- [FS-26](../patterns/fs-26.md) Boundary values and NULL/join semantics not exercised (6)
- [FS-27](../patterns/fs-27.md) Existing primitive or house pattern bypassed (6)
- [FS-15](../patterns/fs-15.md) Producer and consumer of the same data disagree (4)
- [FS-03](../patterns/fs-03.md) Code written against an assumed interface instead of the real one (3)
- [FS-36](../patterns/fs-36.md) Ambiguous or constraint-bearing ask resolved without asking (3)
- [FS-22](../patterns/fs-22.md) Capability built in one layer but never connected to the next (3)
- [FS-08](../patterns/fs-08.md) E2E locator or assertion coupled to incidental page content (2)
