# Task · Dispatch, monitor or resume parallel agents, subagents or worktrees

Orchestration: fanning work out to agents/worktrees, allocating shared ids and files, pinning base SHAs, liveness checks on background agents, resuming vs re-dispatching, cleanup.

in-domain: [cross-cutting](../domains/cross-cutting.md)

predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-45](../patterns/fs-45.md) Agent turn ends waiting on an unverified async mechanism (31)
- [FS-39](../patterns/fs-39.md) Parallel agents dispatched onto overlapping files or allocators (16)
- [FS-05](../patterns/fs-05.md) Concurrent sessions contend for one local DB, port, cache or CPU (14)
- [FS-30](../patterns/fs-30.md) Working from a stale base or without checking existing work (5)
- [FS-64](../patterns/fs-64.md) Destructive or prod-wide write started without an explicit go-ahead for that scope (4)
- [FS-20](../patterns/fs-20.md) Concurrent sessions share one working tree or branch (3)
- [FS-36](../patterns/fs-36.md) Ambiguous or constraint-bearing ask resolved without asking (3)
- [FS-101](../patterns/fs-101.md) Verification and review gates applied uniformly across a large multi-agent run (3)
- [FS-11](../patterns/fs-11.md) Enumerable scope silently shrinks between ask and done (2)
- [FS-18](../patterns/fs-18.md) Shell and CLI step semantics assumed (2)
