# Task · Write or extend a Playwright e2e spec, driver or proof screenshot

Browser test authoring: locators and testids, driver classes, persistence assertions, stubbed responses and timing, seeded data dependencies, proof screenshots.

in-domain: [cross-cutting](../domains/cross-cutting.md)

predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-08](../patterns/fs-08.md) E2E locator or assertion coupled to incidental page content (38)
- [FS-34](../patterns/fs-34.md) Nondeterministic test timing and ordering (31)
- [FS-35](../patterns/fs-35.md) Test depends on uncontrolled shared data or unrealistic setup (21)
- [FS-04](../patterns/fs-04.md) Tests pass without proving the requirement (20)
- [FS-03](../patterns/fs-03.md) Code written against an assumed interface instead of the real one (13)
- [FS-09](../patterns/fs-09.md) Green signal whose scope doesn't cover the claim (9)
- [FS-23](../patterns/fs-23.md) Shared identifier changed or claimed without enumerating its users (9)
- [FS-19](../patterns/fs-19.md) Behavior change leaves dependent tests, drivers and mocks stale (6)
- [FS-33](../patterns/fs-33.md) Test double or harness silently diverges from the real runtime (4)
- [FS-02](../patterns/fs-02.md) Verification against an environment not running the code under test (3)
