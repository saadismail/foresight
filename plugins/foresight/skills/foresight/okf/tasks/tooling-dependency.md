# Task · Add or upgrade a dependency, or change dev tooling, hooks or agent memory

Toolchain changes: adding/removing packages and transitive deps, major tool bumps, git/agent hooks, interpreter pinning, shared memory/config files, heavy local tooling jobs.

- [FS-02](../patterns/fs-02.md) Verification against an environment not running the code under test (4)
