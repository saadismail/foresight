# Task · Refactor, rename or bulk-replace a shared symbol, component, type, label or format

Changes to something many callers depend on: renaming exports, redesigning a shared component's DOM, adding required fields to shared types, copy/format swaps, extracting modules - and the tests/drivers/mocks that assert the old shape.

in-domain: [cross-cutting](../domains/cross-cutting.md)

predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-19](../patterns/fs-19.md) Behavior change leaves dependent tests, drivers and mocks stale (16)
- [FS-23](../patterns/fs-23.md) Shared identifier changed or claimed without enumerating its users (6)
- [FS-07](../patterns/fs-07.md) Parallel code paths for one operation diverge (4)
- [FS-11](../patterns/fs-11.md) Enumerable scope silently shrinks between ask and done (2)
- [FS-03](../patterns/fs-03.md) Code written against an assumed interface instead of the real one (2)
