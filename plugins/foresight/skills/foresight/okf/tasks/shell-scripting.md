# Task · Run shell commands or write a shell / CLI script

Shell mechanics: exit codes through pipes, pkill/pgrep self-matches, cwd and relative paths, quoting and word-splitting, bash versions, inline code in commands, gitignore/pathspec semantics.

in-domain: [cross-cutting](../domains/cross-cutting.md)

predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-18](../patterns/fs-18.md) Shell and CLI step semantics assumed (56)
- [FS-29](../patterns/fs-29.md) Code assumes the host environment it was written on (5)
- [FS-05](../patterns/fs-05.md) Concurrent sessions contend for one local DB, port, cache or CPU (3)
- [FS-63](../patterns/fs-63.md) Entity identity matched on a non-identifying attribute (2)
