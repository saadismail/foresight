# Task · Add an RTK Query endpoint or mutation (cache tags, args, response shape, errors)

Frontend data layer: injectEndpoints, tag wiring and invalidation, paginated-envelope transforms, query-arg key names, data vs currentData on arg changes, mutation error toasts.

in-domain: [web-frontend](../domains/web-frontend.md)

predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-31](../patterns/fs-31.md) Cache identity or invalidation misses a dependency (12)
- [FS-01](../patterns/fs-01.md) Async client state read at the wrong moment or outliving its scope (10)
- [FS-25](../patterns/fs-25.md) Errors swallowed, conflated or silently defaulted (8)
- [FS-23](../patterns/fs-23.md) Shared identifier changed or claimed without enumerating its users (4)
- [FS-22](../patterns/fs-22.md) Capability built in one layer but never connected to the next (4)
- [FS-27](../patterns/fs-27.md) Existing primitive or house pattern bypassed (2)
- [FS-03](../patterns/fs-03.md) Code written against an assumed interface instead of the real one (2)
- [FS-10](../patterns/fs-10.md) Interaction verified only on the mouse happy path (2)
- [FS-07](../patterns/fs-07.md) Parallel code paths for one operation diverge (2)
- [FS-32](../patterns/fs-32.md) Side effects not ordered against the commit or outcome they depend on (2)
