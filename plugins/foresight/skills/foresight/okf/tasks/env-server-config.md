# Task · Change env vars, settings, secrets or live server / container config

Configuring where code runs: settings that read env/.env files or secret stores, host-dependent URLs and addresses, live service config (Postgres, nginx, systemd), containers/clusters, SSH sessions and cloud CLI credentials on remote boxes.

in-domain: [cross-cutting](../domains/cross-cutting.md)

predicts (incidents while doing this task):
- [FS-12](../patterns/fs-12.md) Deploy pipeline doesn't carry or match what the change needs (18)
- [FS-29](../patterns/fs-29.md) Code assumes the host environment it was written on (13)
- [FS-61](../patterns/fs-61.md) Startup path echoes production credentials into captured output (8)
- [FS-66](../patterns/fs-66.md) Session-scoped cloud or CLI credentials assumed still valid (6)
- [FS-93](../patterns/fs-93.md) Live service config edited without a parse check and a post-restart re-read (4)
- [FS-65](../patterns/fs-65.md) Which host, checkout or branch serves an environment assumed (2)
- [FS-42](../patterns/fs-42.md) Third-party system semantics not honored (2)
- [FS-14](../patterns/fs-14.md) Failure cause attributed without a controlled comparison (2)
- [FS-102](../patterns/fs-102.md) Performance lever chosen or credited without profiling, mechanism check or a controlled quiet-host A/B (2)
- [FS-07](../patterns/fs-07.md) Parallel code paths for one operation diverge (2)
